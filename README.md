# OMBD App - Shopify Intern Application 📍
## Hello Shopify team! 👋
My name is Charlie Stableford(they/them) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKWrk8NgCXM. I had a lot of fun with this challenge! 

My process for completing this was to start small, making sure that the functionality of the API calls worked manually, then I added in the search feature. After that I added a simple count feature before expanding to local storage. Once I added the local storage I combined the counting and local storage functionality. Then I added the bells and whistles!
